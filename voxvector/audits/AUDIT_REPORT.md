# VoxVector audit progress

## Current task status

Prompt: **VV-GROUNDTRUTH (Prompt 1), incomplete**. Source revision: `73ac03ded08c161e092ee2a4ecbbed7d036771c8`.

The September 7 user request adds an organized audit archive and detailed AI execution/reporting instructions. This task does not certify the unfinished full documentation review or change current product behavior.

| Task | Status | Evidence or remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read supplied development plan through its end | Complete in preceding audit | Full evidence checkpoint below |
| Inspect source, CI, deployment and connected runtime evidence | Complete for previously bounded checks | Observations retain their original timestamps |
| Locate existing audit owners and archive categories | Complete | Root audit directory, backend docs, frontend docs/data and Bible dossier inventoried |
| Copy records and create source/hash index | Complete | 76 repository records copied; byte identity passed for all; zero destination collisions |
| Write detailed AI audit instructions | Complete | AUDIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md |
| Finish all project and Crown Labs documentation reading | Incomplete | Do not confuse archive copy coverage with semantic review |
| Correct active documentation and corresponding mirrors | Not started | Requires remaining reading; prior discrepancies recorded in checkpoint |
| Verify authenticated workflows and unresolved production trigger | Incomplete | Prior evidence limitations remain |
| Finish Prompt 1 and advance to VV-TRUTHMODEL | Not started | Prompt 1 gates remain open |

## Task log

### Task 1: archive design and instructions

Completed September 7, 2026. Read applicable root and frontend instructions, inspected existing audit paths and history, and created the README, this progress report and AUDIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md. No existing source files were edited. The archive is an explicitly requested collection of evidence copies, not a replacement canonical implementation.

### Prior evidence

The complete preceding audit is preserved at [VV-GROUNDTRUTH-2026-09-07.md](Engineering_Audits/VV-GROUNDTRUTH-2026-09-07.md). Its statement that no repository files had changed describes that earlier checkpoint. This archive task creates new repository files afterward. Existing CI showed 168 passing tests and a successful React build on the source revision above; no new test run is implied.

### Task 2: archive copy and integrity verification

Completed September 7, 2026. Copied 76 tracked records: 6 documentation audits, 10 engineering records, 12 runtime audits, 3 QA records, 35 historical checkpoints, 9 repository audit records and 1 frontend audit-data snapshot. Also preserved the prior full VV-GROUNDTRUTH report. SOURCE_INDEX.md lists every repository source and destination; manifest.json records the source revision, collection timestamp and SHA-256 of each copy.

Checks executed: every copied repository record compared byte for byte against its original; all 76 passed. All 76 destination paths were unique. No original record was changed. No application code, workflow, schema or production service was changed. Application build and browser tests are not applicable to inert Markdown archives and an unimported source snapshot; they were not rerun for this task.

Changed files: all new files under `voxvector/audits/`, consisting of the 76 indexed copies, the preceding full evidence report, README.md, AUDIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md, AUDIT_REPORT.md, SOURCE_INDEX.md and manifest.json. Total: 82 files. Exact copied paths are in SOURCE_INDEX.md. Full documentation alignment remains incomplete.

The archive was committed locally as `d5afb6067fd73ee7dbf215f962f6c95e17aca147` on `docs/voxvector-audit-archive-2026-09-07`. The git whitespace check flagged inherited trailing spaces in historical Markdown copies; these were retained for byte identity. This is a recorded warning, not a clean whitespace-check claim.

Publication is blocked: automatic approval review rejected the git push because the archive may contain sensitive internal audit and engineering information and remote disclosure was not considered authorized. No workaround was attempted after the explicit rejection. No remote branch or PR is claimed. Explicit user approval to publish this archive to `darenprince/darenprince-author` is required to resolve this publication blocker.

### Task 3: GitHub tracking and publication

The user explicitly authorized publishing the archive and creating task tickets on September 7, 2026. This resolves the earlier authorization blocker. Shell git push then failed because no GitHub username credential was available; publication proceeds through the authenticated GitHub connector.

Created [execution tracker #915](https://github.com/darenprince/darenprince-author/issues/915) and five bounded tickets: [documentation alignment #910](https://github.com/darenprince/darenprince-author/issues/910), [publish trigger #911](https://github.com/darenprince/darenprince-author/issues/911), [speech provenance #912](https://github.com/darenprince/darenprince-author/issues/912), [Prompt 1 closure #913](https://github.com/darenprince/darenprince-author/issues/913), and [truth model #914](https://github.com/darenprince/darenprince-author/issues/914). Each records scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies and the report update requirement. Existing open issues were checked; the related general Pages issue #517 remains separate and linked.

Workflow: Backlog → Ready → In progress → In review → Done; record Blocked with a reason and dependency. Status is recorded in issue bodies, not an automated board. Select one implementation task at a time, assign an owner when work starts, attach evidence and a PR, and close only after acceptance criteria are verified. Later prompt gates remain in #915's backlog. The archive PR does not close the full audit.

## Next task

Continue the outstanding documentation review from the recorded checkpoint. Do not repeat already completed service discovery without a specific evidence need. Next planned prompt after completing VV-GROUNDTRUTH is VV-TRUTHMODEL.

Here is your revised Codex prompt — strictly based on what you actually told me:

⸻

Codex Prompt:

Build a temporary “Site Under Maintenance” landing page for DarenPrince.com using the Game On! brand identity. Use the official fonts and color palette.

Page structure should include:

1. Hero Section
• Include a heading image at the top of the page.
• Headline: “Daren’s Site is Leveling Up”
• Subtext: “Game on, even when the page is down. We’re upgrading the experience — faster, sleeker, bolder. Hang tight.”

2. Get the Book Section
• Include a mockup image placeholder for the book.
• Below the image, place a collapsible book description section (accordion).
• The accordion should be expanded and fully visible by default on page load.
• Use rich descriptive text for the book pulled directly from the long-form product description. No truncation.

3. Contact Section
• Add a simple contact form with fields: Name, Email, and Message.
• Do not reference any component includes. Build the form markup directly.
• Below the form, display this note: “For media, interviews, or reader messages, contact: press@darenprince.com”

4. Bookstore Logo Links
• At the bottom of the page, add a row of bookstore logos with links.
• Use the following stores and link them appropriately:
• Amazon: https://a.co/d/irajx1w
• Apple Books: https://books.apple.com/us/book/game-on-master-the-conversation-win-her-heart/id6745466900
• Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BYFbEQAAQBAJ
• Books-A-Million: https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Game-Master-Conversation-Win-Her/Daren-Prince/9798303844407
• ThriftBooks: https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/game-on-master-the-conversation–win-her-heart-the-comprehensive-mens-playbook-for-flirting-seduction-dating–amazing-relationships_daren-prince/54448380
• Waterstones: https://www.waterstones.com/book/game-on-master-the-conversation-and-win-her-heart/daren-prince/9798303844407
• Codex should locate existing logo assets already uploaded in the repo by filename.

Final instructions:
• All spacing must follow REM-based system
• Do not truncate or summarize any copy
• Accordion must be open by default
• No external includes or component calls
• Stay consistent with Game On’s tone: bold, grounded, emotionally intelligent

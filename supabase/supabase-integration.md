# Supabase Integration Quickstart

The authoritative playbook, schema notes, and operational runbooks all live at [`docs/supabase/README.md`](../docs/supabase/README.md). This local stub simply collects jump links to the most common project artifacts.

## Quick links

- **Edge functions:** `functions/secure-storage/index.ts`, `functions/admin-users/index.ts`
- **Migrations:** `migrations/` (see `0005_admin_action_log.sql` for the admin console audit log)
- **SQL helpers:** `sql_editor_setup.sql`
- **Admin UI entry point:** `../admin-user-management.html`

Refer to the README for environment provisioning, deployment commands, and policy guidance; keeping a single source of truth prevents documentation drift.

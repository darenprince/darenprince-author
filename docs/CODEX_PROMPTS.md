# 🧠 CODEX_PROMPTS.md — Codex Prompt Library (Live Site Expansion)

This file defines modular, SCSS-based prompt logic for continuing development of the official Daren Prince Author Website. Every prompt must follow the global rules defined below.

---

## 🔁 GLOBAL CONFIG PROMPT

```
Always:
- Use dark mode by default
- Build with CodyHouse SCSS logic, mobile-first
- Maintain SCSS folder structure: components/, layout/, tokens/, etc.
- Use spacing system defined in MASTER_PLAN.md
- Brand colors must follow HEX palette, no approximations
- Every time a component is added or modified:
  • Add demo version to components.html
  • Update CODEX_PROMPTS.md with prompt used
  • Document logic inside /docs/ or /scss/ if needed
- Never use dashes, hyphens, or shorthand content
- No external libraries — everything must be native, modular, and reusable
```

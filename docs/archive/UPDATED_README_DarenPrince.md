# 🖥️ Daren Prince Author Platform & Website
⚠️ **Legacy:** This file is kept for historical reference. For the latest information see `docs/README.md`.

Welcome to the official development repository for **Daren M. Prince**, bestselling author of *Game On! Master the Conversation & Win Her Heart*. This site is the digital command center for Daren’s entire brand ecosystem – designed to convert browsers into readers, amplify the author's voice, and build a movement around real connection, emotional intelligence, and modern masculinity.

---

## ⚡️ Mission

This project is built to:

- Showcase Daren’s published and upcoming books
- Deliver his message with confidence, clarity, and brand consistency
- Powerfully reflect the Game On! brand identity (fonts, colors, energy, language)
- Support future expansions like courses, member access, podcasting, affiliate integration, and more
- Be deployed lightning-fast via Netlify with clean modular SCSS and prompt-driven component builds via OpenAI Codex

---

## 🔧 Stack Overview

- **Framework**: Pure HTML + Modular SCSS (CodyHouse-style system)
- **Dark Mode Default**: Site is styled with dark mode as the baseline
- **Build Tools**: Node, npm, Netlify CLI
- **Auto Deployment**: Netlify CI/CD connected to GitHub main branch
- **Prompt Engine**: Codex by OpenAI powers real-time generation of components, prompts, and site logic

---

## 🧠 Codex Integration

This project is driven by AI collaboration through OpenAI’s Codex:

- Modular prompts generate SCSS components
- Systematic integration with Codex logic tracked in `docs/CODEX_PROMPTS.md`
- Brand-aware personality definitions in `docs/AGENTS.md`

⚠️ All prompts, component logic, and layout flow must follow the official strategy and never deviate from:
- Brand fonts
- HEX color values
- REM-based spacing logic
- No dashes, no truncation, no approximations

---

## 🎨 Visual Identity

Brand identity is governed by the **Game On! Press Kit** (stored in `/assets/brand/`).

**Official Fonts:**
- League Spartan (Primary Headline)
- Futura (Secondary Headline / Navigation)
- Knockout Welterweight (Accents & Stylized Labels)
- Helvetica Now (Body, System, Utility)

**Color Palette:**
- `#FDFDFD` White
- `#D5D5D5` Light Gray
- `#B8BAB7` Medium Gray
- `#3B3C3B` Charcoal
- `#070A06` Black
- `#456F3A` Deep Green
- `#6DA667` Medium Green
- `#87BD72` Bright Green
- `#8CD679` Light Lime Green
- `#C2E9C1` Mint Green

Design must follow clean, bold, masculine UI logic with large readable typography, generous spacing, and no frills.

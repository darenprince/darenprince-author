# Support the Author Payment Gateway Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement a frictionless "Support the Author" experience using Stripe's Buy Button while maintaining flexibility for future donation tiers and membership upgrades. The plan below covers technical integration, UX considerations, and operational readiness so the gateway feels native to the Daren Prince experience.

## 1. Stripe Buy Button Integration

- **Embed script once per page:** Load `https://js.stripe.com/v3/buy-button.js` in the global layout or a reusable partial to prevent duplicate downloads.
- **Component-ize the button:** Wrap the `<stripe-buy-button>` markup in a CodyHouse-inspired component (e.g., `components/_support-author-button.html`) with SCSS hooks so it can be reused on landing pages, blog posts, and modals.
- **Pass dynamic metadata:** Use data attributes or server-side rendering to inject `client_reference_id`, reader email (when known), and source page to assist attribution and follow-up messaging via Stripe's customer object.

## 2. UX & Visual Design

- **Dark-mode first styling:** Encapsulate the button in a dark-surface container that matches Daren's brand palette, with supportive copy such as “Fuel the mission. Support Daren’s next breakthrough.”
- **Responsive layout:** Add utility classes so the button fits hero sections on desktop while collapsing into a full-width CTA on mobile.
- **Trust signals:** Pair the button with testimonials or value props pulled from existing CodyHouse cards to reinforce impact prior to payment.

## 3. Progressive Enhancement & Fallbacks

- **Graceful fallback:** When JavaScript is disabled or Stripe fails to load, show a secondary link to a hosted Stripe Checkout page or a downloadable PDF with manual contribution options.
- **Loading states:** Add a skeleton shimmer or spinner until the web component hydrates; hide the iframe once the button is ready to prevent layout shift.

## 4. Content Personalization

- **Dynamic copy variants:** Leverage the upcoming data platform or existing CMS fields to personalize the appeal based on the page type (e.g., success stories vs. technical labs).
- **Suggested amounts:** Use behavioral data to surface context-aware contribution tiers or one-click upsells into memberships.

## 5. Analytics & Testing

- **Event instrumentation:** Fire custom analytics events (Amplitude/GTM) on button impression, hover, click, and successful completion using Stripe’s `session.created` webhook payloads.
- **A/B testing:** Experiment with button copy, placement, and suggested amounts using feature flags (e.g., LaunchDarkly) or Netlify split testing.

## 6. Backend & Operations

- **Webhook listener:** Deploy a Netlify function (or the future data provider's edge runtime) to capture `checkout.session.completed`, then tag supporters in the CRM, send personalized thank-you emails, and trigger fulfillment (e.g., downloadable bonuses).
- **Security best practices:** Store the publishable key client-side only; keep secret keys within environment variables for serverless functions. Rotate keys periodically and enforce TLS on all endpoints.
- **Refund & support flow:** Document a playbook for customer support, including how to issue refunds or resend receipts directly from Stripe Dashboard.

## 7. Roadmap Extensions

- **Membership bridge:** Offer a post-payment upgrade path to the full membership portal with a one-click Stripe customer portal link.
- **Recurring support:** Introduce a subscription-based "Patron" tier using Stripe Billing when repeat contributions become common.
- **Impact storytelling:** After each campaign, update supporters via automated emails and site sections that highlight progress unlocked by contributions.

**Next Steps:**

1. Build the reusable support button component and SCSS partial.
2. Wire up the Netlify webhook (or upcoming data platform listener) to capture Stripe events.
3. Craft analytics dashboards to monitor conversion, retention, and A/B outcomes.

# Supabase integration (Netlify marketplace stub)

This file previously mirrored the generic Netlify marketplace copy. The authoritative guide for this project now lives in [`docs/SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md`](SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md).

Use that document for environment variables, schema details, and deployment steps specific to the Daren Prince platform. The Netlify UI flow (installing the marketplace integration) still applies if you choose to manage credentials there, but all project-specific instructions are maintained in the canonical guide.

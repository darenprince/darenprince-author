You are updating the `darenprince/darenprince-author` site to integrate a complete swatch library taken from Canva.
Every swatch is a two-stop vertical gradient (top->bottom) with an exact border stroke and an exact cloud/text colour.
Do not approximate. Do not refactor existing classes. This change is additive only.

## Inputs (already supplied in this package)
- `assets/css/canva-swatches.ALL.generated.css`  ← tokens + classes for all detected swatches
- `docs/canva-swatches.ALL.generated.html`       ← catalog fragment (button + container + tokens per swatch)
- `swatch_catalog_all.csv` / `swatch_catalog_all.json` ← raw values (top, bottom, border, text)

## Goals
1) Include the generated CSS in the site so classes are available.
2) Embed the generated HTML fragment in the style guide so every swatch is visible.
3) Preserve existing behaviour. No deletions or renames of current CSS.
4) Ensure icons use `currentColor` so they inherit the swatch text colour.

## Exact steps
1. Create a new branch: `feature/canva-swatches`.
2. Place files into the repo with these paths:
   - `assets/css/canva-swatches.generated.css`  (copy from this package's ALL css)
   - `docs/canva-swatches.generated.html`       (copy from this package's ALL html)
   - Add `tools/extract_swatches.py` only if it does not exist already (generator is optional at runtime).
3. Edit `docs/style-guide.html` (ADD-ONLY):
   - In the <head>, AFTER existing stylesheet links, add:
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/canva-swatches.generated.css">
     <style>
       #canva-swatches .swatch-grid { display:grid; grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fill,minmax(260px,1fr)); gap:1rem; }
       #canva-swatches .swatch { background:#1f1f1f0d; padding:1rem; border-radius:.6rem; border:1px solid #e5e5e5; }
       #canva-swatches .tokens { display:block; margin-top:.75rem; font-size:.85rem; word-break:break-word; }
       #canva-swatches .preview svg { margin-right:.5rem; vertical-align:-2px; }
     </style>
   - In the BODY, where you want the catalog to appear, paste the entire contents of `docs/canva-swatches.generated.html`.
     (If your doc builder supports includes, you can keep it as a separate file and include it. Otherwise inline it.)
4. Commit your changes:
   git add assets/css/canva-swatches.generated.css docs/canva-swatches.generated.html docs/style-guide.html
   git commit -m "Add Canva swatch gradients, borders, and text colours (exact 2-stop) + style-guide catalog"
   git push origin feature/canva-swatches
5. Open a Pull Request: base = main, compare = feature/canva-swatches.

## Constraints
- Two-stop gradients only: linear-gradient(180deg, <top> 0%, <bottom> 100%).
- Use exact border and cloud/text colours per swatch — values are in the CSS and JSON/CSV.
- No breaking changes; the site must render as before if none of the new classes are used.
- Icons/SVGs must use `fill="currentColor"`.
